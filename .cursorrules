# Godspeed Bulldogs Website - Cursor AI Rules

## Project Identity
You are working on the Godspeed Bulldogs website - a premium English Bulldog breeding business website owned by Logan Folse in Austin, Texas. This website was transformed from a Southside Detail & Tint auto detailing template. The site's primary purpose is to capture waitlist signups and reserve deposits for upcoming litters.

## Business Context
- Business: Godspeed Bulldogs (English Bulldog breeder)
- Owner: Logan Folse
- Location: Austin, Texas
- Next litter: Spring 2026
- Pricing: $6,500-$8,500 per puppy
- Target audience: Gen Z & Millennials (25-40 years old)
- First litter success: Sold to professional athletes (Jalen Reed, Maason)

## Brand Guidelines - CRITICAL
- **Color Palette**: Black (#000), White (#FFF), Cyan (#00e5ff), Green (#00ff88)
- **Visual Style**: Luxury-streetwear fusion aesthetic with cyan/green accents
- **MANDATORY**: ALL white text MUST have cyan glow effect: `text-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0,229,255,0.6)` or similar
- **Typography**: Poppins font family (weights: 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800)
- **Logo Paths**: `/assets/images/logo/` (with fallback to `/assets/images/original logo/`)

## Technical Stack
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (NO frameworks)
- GoHighLevel CRM integration via webhook forms
- Mobile-first responsive design (test on 375px, 414px, 768px)
- Performance-optimized: lazy loading, image optimization
- Hero section uses image carousel (NOT video) for better performance

## Development Standards
- **Mobile-First**: Always design for mobile first, then scale up
- **Performance Targets**: Lighthouse 90+ mobile, 95+ desktop
- **Images**: Use lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`), responsive srcset where appropriate
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for mobile
- **No Emojis**: Unless explicitly requested by user
- **Cyan Glow**: Apply to ALL white text elements (headings, body text, links, buttons, footer)
- **Code Style**: Clean, semantic HTML; organized CSS; vanilla JavaScript

## File Structure
- **Config Files**: `/content/*.json` (business-info, branding, services, testimonials, social-links)
- **Images**: `/assets/images/bulldogs/` (hero, gallery, parents, lifestyle subfolders)
- **Pages**: `index.html`, `waitlist.html`, `thank-you.html`, `gallery.html`
- **Styling**: `/assets/css/` (nav.css, style.css, products-grid.css, products.css)
- **Scripts**: `/assets/js/` (nav.js, main.js, versioning.js)
- **Knowledge Base**: `/knowledge base/` (reference docs for GHL integration, business logic)

## GoHighLevel Integration
- **Form Action**: `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/hooks/WEBHOOK_ID_HERE` (placeholder - replace with actual webhook)
- **Form Fields**: first_name, last_name, email, phone, budget_range, timeline, preferred_gender, referral_source, comments
- **Hidden Fields**: source="Waitlist Form", tags="Waitlist,Website Lead"
- **Success Redirect**: `thank-you.html`
- **Field Mapping**: Map to GHL custom fields (Budget Range, Timeline, Gender Preference, Lead Source)

## Project Status

### Completed ✅
- Homepage transformation (index.html) - hero carousel, services, about sections
- Waitlist form page (waitlist.html) - GHL-ready with proper field mapping
- Thank you page (thank-you.html) - confirmation with next steps
- Navigation & footer - updated across all pages
- All JSON configuration files - business info, branding, services, testimonials, social links
- SEO & meta tags - optimized for "English Bulldog breeder Austin TX"
- Image organization - 4 hero images + 24 gallery images copied and organized

### Pending ⏳
- Gallery page transformation (gallery.html) - masonry layout with lazy loading
- Terms of Service update (terms-of-service.html) - breeding niche, maintain A2P compliance
- Privacy Policy update (privacy-policy.html) - breeding business context
- Performance optimization pass - additional lazy loading, image compression
- Comprehensive mobile testing - multiple viewports and devices

## Key Requirements
1. **Waitlist Capture**: Primary goal - capture leads via waitlist form
2. **Reserve Deposits**: Secondary goal - $1,000 deposit collection (handled in GHL, not website)
3. **Mobile Optimization**: 100% mobile testing required for all changes
4. **Performance**: Ship minimal JS, lazy-load images, optimize assets
5. **Brand Consistency**: Cyan glow on white text, black/white/cyan/green color scheme throughout

## Code Patterns
- **Hero Images**: Use opacity transitions for carousel (smooth, performant)
- **Forms**: Large touch targets, clear labels, proper validation
- **Buttons**: Cyan/Green gradient background (#00e5ff to #00ff88), hover effects with glow
- **Sections**: Dark backgrounds with subtle cyan/green accents
- **Text**: White text with cyan glow shadow for visibility and brand consistency

## Knowledge Base Reference
- Master guide: `/knowledge base/godspeed_bulldogs_master_guide.md`
- MVP checklist: `/knowledge base/$99 ZeroMotion Breeder System - MVP MUST-HAVE CHECKLIST.md`
- Technical breakdown: `/knowledge base/technical_breakdown.md`
- Business context: Owner is building this as a reusable snapshot to sell to other breeders ($99 setup + $99/month)

## Next Steps Priority
1. Gallery page with bulldog images + masonry layout + lightbox
2. Terms of Service update (keep A2P SMS compliance language)
3. Privacy Policy update
4. Performance optimization (lazy loading, image compression, Lighthouse audit)
5. Mobile testing across devices

## Important Notes
- This is a reusable template - code should be maintainable and well-documented
- A2P compliance is critical for SMS/communication - don't remove consent language
- All forms must integrate with GoHighLevel webhooks
- Images are sourced from Instagram export in `/godspeedbulldogs` folder
- Test all changes on mobile viewports before marking complete
